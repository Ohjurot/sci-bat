        <p class="card-text"> GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.] Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away yourfreedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General PublicLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and changefree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to somespecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of theFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. Youcan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whetherthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the betterstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure thatyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and chargefor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can getit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces ofit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can dothese things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbiddistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender theserights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities foryou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratisor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gaveyou. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the sourcecode. If you link other code with the library, you must providecomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink themwith the library after making changes to the library and recompilingit. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright thelibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legalpermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear thatthere is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library ismodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should knowthat what they have is not the original version, so that the originalauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might beintroduced by others. Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence ofany free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannoteffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining arestrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist thatany patent license obtained for a version of the library must beconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by theordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU LesserGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, andis quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We usethis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking thoselibraries into non-free programs. When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or usinga shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking acombined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinaryGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if theentire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser GeneralPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code withthe library. We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because itdoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary GeneralPublic License. It also provides other free software developers Lessof an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantagesare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for manylibraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certainspecial circumstances. For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need toencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomesa de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must beallowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a freelibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In thiscase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to freesoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-freeprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body offree software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library innon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNUoperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operatingsystem. Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of theusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that islinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to runthat program using a modified version of the Library. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution andmodification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". Theformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter mustbe combined with the library in order to run. GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or otherprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder orother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms ofthis Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").Each licensee is addressed as "you". A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or dataprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or workwhich has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on theLibrary" means either the Library or any derivative work undercopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or aportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translatedstraightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation isincluded without limitation in the term "modification".) "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work formaking modifications to it. For a library, complete source code meansall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associatedinterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilationand installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are notcovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act ofrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output fromsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work basedon the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool forwriting it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library doesand what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library'scomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided thatyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy anappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intactall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of anywarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with theLibrary. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for afee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portionof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy anddistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. Ifidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works inthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to thosesections when you distribute them as separate works. But when youdistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work basedon the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms ofthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to theentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wroteit.Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contestyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is toexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative orcollective works based on the Library.In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Librarywith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume ofa storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work underthe scope of this License. 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General PublicLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To dothis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, sothat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of theordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specifythat version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change inthese notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible forthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to allsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code ofthe Library into a program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion orderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable formunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompanyit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, whichmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on amedium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copyfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy thesource code from the same place satisfies the requirement todistribute the source code, even though third parties are notcompelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of theLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled orlinked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such awork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, andtherefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Librarycreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because itcontains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses thelibrary". The executable is therefore covered by this License.Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header filethat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be aderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can belinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. Thethreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, datastructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inlinefunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the objectfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivativework. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of theLibrary will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you maydistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine orlink a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce awork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that workunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permitmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverseengineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that theLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered bythis License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the workduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include thecopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a referencedirecting the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do oneof these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses theLibrary" must include any data and utility programs needed forreproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,the materials to be distributed need not include anything that isnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the majorcomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system onwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompaniesthe executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the licenserestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normallyaccompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannotuse both them and the Library together in an executable that youdistribute. 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on theLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other libraryfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combinedlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based onthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwisepermitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distributethe Library except as expressly provided under this License. Anyattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, ordistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate yourrights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,or rights, from you under this License will not have their licensesterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have notsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify ordistribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions areprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, bymodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, andall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifyingthe Library or works based on it. 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from theoriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Librarysubject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any furtherrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties withthis License. 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement orotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do notexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannotdistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under thisLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence youmay not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patentlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library byall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, thenthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be torefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under anyparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe anypatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of anysuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting theintegrity of the free software distribution system which isimplemented by public license practices. Many people have madegenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributedthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of thatsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willingto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannotimpose that choice.This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed tobe a consequence of the rest of this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted incertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, theoriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may addan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thusexcluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as ifwritten in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or newversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Libraryspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and"any later version", you have the option of following the terms andconditions either of that version or of any later version published bythe Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify alicense version number, you may choose any version ever published bythe Free Software Foundation. 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other freeprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,write to the author to ask for permission. For software which iscopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the FreeSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Ourdecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free statusof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharingand reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NOWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OROTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANYKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THEIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THELIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUMETHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO INWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFYAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOUFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL ORCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THELIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEINGRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR AFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IFSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCHDAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatestpossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software thateveryone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permittingredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of theordinary General Public License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It issafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivelyconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USAAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or yourschool, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, ifnecessary.

REQUIREMENTS3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then: a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license: i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&apos; rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code: a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitationsof liability (&quot;notices&quot;) contained within the Program from any copy ofthe Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may addtheir own appropriate notices.4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTIONCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilitieswith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While thislicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial productoffering should do so in a manner which does not create potentialliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includesthe Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor(&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify everyother Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses,damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuitsand other legal actions brought by a third party against the IndemnifiedContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of suchCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Programin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do notapply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or allegedintellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an IndemnifiedContributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor inwriting of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and anyrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor mayparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercialproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a CommercialContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performanceclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performanceclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibilityalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have todefend claims against the other Contributors related to those performanceclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor topay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must paythose damages.5. NO WARRANTYEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENTPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot;BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS ORIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OFTITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining theappropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes allrisks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programsor equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITYEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENTPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORSSHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSTPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER INCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THEEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THEPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.7. GENERALIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable underapplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability ofthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without furtheraction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to theminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that theProgram itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other softwareor hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;srights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date suchlitigation is filed.All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if itfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of thisAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period oftime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;srights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease useand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under this Agreement and any licensesgranted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted andmay only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Stewardreserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) ofthis Agreement from time to time. No one other than the AgreementSteward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundationis the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign theresponsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separateentity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishingversion number. The Program (including Contributions) may always beDistributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it wasreceived. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including itsContributions) under the new version.Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipientreceives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of anyContributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly grantedunder this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intendedto be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice&quot;This Source Code may also be made available under the followingSecondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forthin the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.&quot; Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses. If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice. You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
