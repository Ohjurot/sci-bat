            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license forsoftware and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designedto take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom toshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains freesoftware for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use theGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also toany other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it toyour programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, notprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that youhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge forthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if youwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in newfree programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying youthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you havecertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or ifyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whethergratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the samefreedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receiveor can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so theyknow their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this Licensegiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explainsthat there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' andauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked aschanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously toauthors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or runmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturercan do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim ofprotecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematicpattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals touse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, wehave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for thoseproducts. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, westand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versionsof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.States should not allow patents to restrict development and use ofsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish toavoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program couldmake it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures thatpatents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution andmodification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds ofworks, such as semiconductor masks. &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under thisLicense. Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. &quot;Licensees&quot; and&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations. To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the workin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of anexact copy. The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of theearlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work. A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work basedon the Program. To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, withoutpermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable forinfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on acomputer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,distribution (with or without modification), making available to thepublic, and in some countries other activities as well. To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables otherparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user througha computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visiblefeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to theextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey thework under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. Ifthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as amenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the workfor making modifications to it. &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-sourceform of a work. A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an officialstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case ofinterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one thatis widely used among developers working in that language. The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, otherthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form ofpackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that MajorComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with thatMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which animplementation is available to the public in source code form. A&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used toproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means allthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executablework) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts tocontrol those activities. However, it does not include the work'sSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available freeprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities butwhich are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Sourceincludes interface definition files associated with source files forthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamicallylinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,such as by intimate data communication or control flow between thosesubprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that userscan regenerate automatically from other parts of the CorrespondingSource. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is thatsame work. 2. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term ofcopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the statedconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimitedpermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running acovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given itscontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges yourrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do notconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remainsin force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purposeof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide youwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply withthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you donot control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered worksfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your directionand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies ofyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely underthe conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technologicalmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, orsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of suchmeasures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbidcircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumventionis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect tothe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation ormodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work'susers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention oftechnological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as youreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously andappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;keep intact all notices stating that this License and anynon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give allrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications toproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under theterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;. c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independentworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are notused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's usersbeyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered workin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the otherparts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the termsof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey themachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excludedfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not beincluded in conveying the object code work. A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means anytangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporationinto a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particularproduct received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to atypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the statusof the particular user or of the way in which the particular useractually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A productis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantialcommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses representthe only significant mode of use of the product. &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to installand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product froma modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information mustsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified objectcode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely becausemodification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, orspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs aspart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of theUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for afixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), theCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompaniedby the Installation Information. But this requirement does not applyif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to installmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work hasbeen installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include arequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updatesfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or forthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to anetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially andadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules andprotocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,in accord with this section must be in a format that is publiclydocumented (and with an implementation available to the public insource code form), and must require no special password or key forunpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms. &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of thisLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shallbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extentthat they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissionsapply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separatelyunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed bythis License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your optionremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part ofit. (Additional permissions may be written to require their ownremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may placeadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material youadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders ofthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;furtherrestrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as youreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it isgoverned by this License along with a term that is a furtherrestriction, you may remove that term. If a license document containsa further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under thisLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the termsof that license document, provided that the further restriction doesnot survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, youmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of theadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicatingwhere to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in theform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expresslyprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate ormodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights underthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the thirdparagraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then yourlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly andfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyrightholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable meansprior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder isreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of theviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you havereceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from thatcopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days afteryour receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate thelicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you underthis License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanentlyreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the samematerial under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive orrun a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered workoccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmissionto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate ormodify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you donot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating acovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automaticallyreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify andpropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsiblefor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of anorganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing anorganization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a coveredwork results from an entity transaction, each party to thattransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whateverlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or couldgive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of theCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, ifthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of therights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you maynot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise ofrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging thatany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering forsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents. A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under thisLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. Thework thus licensed is called the contributor's &quot;contributor version&quot;. A contributor's &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claimsowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired orhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permittedby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,but do not include claims that would be infringed only as aconsequence of further modification of the contributor version. Forpurposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grantpatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements ofthis License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-freepatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, tomake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify andpropagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any expressagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not tosue for patent infringement). To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to aparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce apatent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyoneto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through apublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be soavailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of thepatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a mannerconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patentlicense to downstream recipients. &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you haveactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying thecovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered workin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in thatcountry that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction orarrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, acovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the partiesreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modifyor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent licenseyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the coveredwork and works based on it. A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include withinthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or isconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that arespecifically granted under this License. You may not convey a coveredwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that isin the business of distributing software, under which you make paymentto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveyingthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of theparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatorypatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered workconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarilyfor and in connection with specific products or compilations thatcontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limitingany implied license or other defenses to infringement that mayotherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement orotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do notexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey acovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under thisLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you maynot convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate youto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you conveythe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and thisLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you havepermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensedunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a singlecombined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of thisLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to thecombination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions ofthe GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions willbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail toaddress new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If theProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU GeneralPublic License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have theoption of following the terms and conditions either of that numberedversion or of any later version published by the Free SoftwareFoundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of theGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever publishedby the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which futureversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy'spublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes youto choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or differentpermissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on anyauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow alater version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BYAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHTHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTYOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAMIS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OFALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITINGWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYSTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANYGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THEUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OFDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRDPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OFSUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability providedabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximatesan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with theProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies acopy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatestpossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make itfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safestto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivelystate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at leastthe &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt; This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a shortnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: &lt;program&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt; This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriateparts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commandsmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an &quot;about box&quot;. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see&lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;. The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your programinto proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, youmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications withthe library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser GeneralPublic License instead of this License. But first, please read&lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.

        <p class="card-text"> GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.] Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away yourfreedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General PublicLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and changefree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to somespecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of theFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. Youcan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whetherthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the betterstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure thatyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and chargefor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can getit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces ofit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can dothese things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbiddistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender theserights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities foryou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratisor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gaveyou. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the sourcecode. If you link other code with the library, you must providecomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink themwith the library after making changes to the library and recompilingit. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright thelibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legalpermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear thatthere is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library ismodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should knowthat what they have is not the original version, so that the originalauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might beintroduced by others. Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence ofany free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannoteffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining arestrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist thatany patent license obtained for a version of the library must beconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by theordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU LesserGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, andis quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We usethis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking thoselibraries into non-free programs. When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or usinga shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking acombined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinaryGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if theentire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser GeneralPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code withthe library. We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because itdoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary GeneralPublic License. It also provides other free software developers Lessof an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantagesare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for manylibraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certainspecial circumstances. For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need toencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomesa de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must beallowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a freelibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In thiscase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to freesoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-freeprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body offree software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library innon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNUoperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operatingsystem. Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of theusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that islinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to runthat program using a modified version of the Library. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution andmodification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". Theformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter mustbe combined with the library in order to run. GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or otherprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder orother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms ofthis Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").Each licensee is addressed as "you". A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or dataprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or workwhich has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on theLibrary" means either the Library or any derivative work undercopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or aportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translatedstraightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation isincluded without limitation in the term "modification".) "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work formaking modifications to it. For a library, complete source code meansall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associatedinterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilationand installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are notcovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act ofrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output fromsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work basedon the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool forwriting it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library doesand what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library'scomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided thatyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy anappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intactall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of anywarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with theLibrary. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for afee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portionof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy anddistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. Ifidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works inthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to thosesections when you distribute them as separate works. But when youdistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work basedon the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms ofthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to theentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wroteit.Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contestyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is toexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative orcollective works based on the Library.In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Librarywith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume ofa storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work underthe scope of this License. 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General PublicLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To dothis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, sothat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of theordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specifythat version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change inthese notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible forthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to allsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code ofthe Library into a program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion orderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable formunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompanyit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, whichmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on amedium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copyfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy thesource code from the same place satisfies the requirement todistribute the source code, even though third parties are notcompelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of theLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled orlinked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such awork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, andtherefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Librarycreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because itcontains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses thelibrary". The executable is therefore covered by this License.Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header filethat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be aderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can belinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. Thethreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, datastructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inlinefunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the objectfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivativework. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of theLibrary will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you maydistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine orlink a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce awork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that workunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permitmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverseengineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that theLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered bythis License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the workduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include thecopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a referencedirecting the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do oneof these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses theLibrary" must include any data and utility programs needed forreproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,the materials to be distributed need not include anything that isnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the majorcomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system onwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompaniesthe executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the licenserestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normallyaccompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannotuse both them and the Library together in an executable that youdistribute. 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on theLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other libraryfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combinedlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based onthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwisepermitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distributethe Library except as expressly provided under this License. Anyattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, ordistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate yourrights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,or rights, from you under this License will not have their licensesterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have notsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify ordistribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions areprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, bymodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, andall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifyingthe Library or works based on it. 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from theoriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Librarysubject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any furtherrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties withthis License. 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement orotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do notexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannotdistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under thisLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence youmay not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patentlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library byall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, thenthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be torefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under anyparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe anypatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of anysuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting theintegrity of the free software distribution system which isimplemented by public license practices. Many people have madegenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributedthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of thatsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willingto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannotimpose that choice.This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed tobe a consequence of the rest of this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted incertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, theoriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may addan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thusexcluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as ifwritten in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or newversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Libraryspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and"any later version", you have the option of following the terms andconditions either of that version or of any later version published bythe Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify alicense version number, you may choose any version ever published bythe Free Software Foundation. 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other freeprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,write to the author to ask for permission. For software which iscopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the FreeSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Ourdecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free statusof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharingand reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NOWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OROTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANYKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THEIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THELIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUMETHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO INWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFYAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOUFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL ORCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THELIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEINGRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR AFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IFSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCHDAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatestpossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software thateveryone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permittingredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of theordinary General Public License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It issafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivelyconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USAAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or yourschool, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, ifnecessary. Here is a sample; alter the names: Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker. <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of ViceThat's all there is to it!</p>

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.1. DEFINITIONS&quot;Contribution&quot; means: a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: i) changes to the Program, and ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &quot;originates&quot; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor whichare necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution aloneor when combined with the Program.&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with thisAgreement.&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreementor any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or otherform, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which theeditorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modificationsrepresent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.&quot;Modified Works&quot; shall mean any work in Source Code or other form thatresults from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of thecontents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new filein Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program.

GRANT OF RIGHTS a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works. b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient&apos;s receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).3. REQUIREMENTS3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then: a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license: i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&apos; rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code: a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitationsof liability (&quot;notices&quot;) contained within the Program from any copy ofthe Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may addtheir own appropriate notices.4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTIONCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilitieswith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While thislicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial productoffering should do so in a manner which does not create potentialliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includesthe Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor(&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify everyother Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses,damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuitsand other legal actions brought by a third party against the IndemnifiedContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of suchCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Programin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do notapply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or allegedintellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an IndemnifiedContributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor inwriting of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and anyrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor mayparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercialproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a CommercialContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performanceclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performanceclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibilityalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have todefend claims against the other Contributors related to those performanceclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor topay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must paythose damages.5. NO WARRANTYEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENTPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot;BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS ORIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OFTITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining theappropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes allrisks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programsor equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITYEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENTPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORSSHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSTPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER INCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THEEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THEPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.7. GENERALIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable underapplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability ofthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without furtheraction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to theminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that theProgram itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other softwareor hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;srights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date suchlitigation is filed.All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if itfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of thisAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period oftime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;srights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease useand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under this Agreement and any licensesgranted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted andmay only be modified in the following manner.
